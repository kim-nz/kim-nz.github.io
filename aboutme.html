<h2 class="header1">It's Me! Kim Anand</h2> 
<img class="roundPic center" src="picture-of-me.jpg" alt="It's Kim!">
 <p class="p">Kia Ora! My name is Kim, I grew up in Tamaki Makaurau (Auckland). <br><br>I have also lived in Melbourne and Toronto for extended periods of time and consider both cities my homes away from home. <br><br>
  I used to work in the Shipping industry but mid-pandemic I decided it was time for a change. <br><br>
  Reading is one of my favorite pass-times and you can usually find me in a sunny corner of the house with a cup of coffee and a book.<br><br>
  I'm also about to start learning how to make pottery. I was surprised by how popular pottery classes are - the class I'm enrolled in sold out in less than 3 minutes!<br></br>
  Apparently I've decided 2022 is the year to really stretch myself because I've also taken up GOLF. <strong>GOLF!</strong> My dad was an avid golfer back in his day and really wanted me and my sister to learn when we were younger - we had no interest. 
  However, a few of my friends in Toronto played, and we ended up spending quite a bit of time at driving ranges. Yo. Golf is HARD. It's endlessly technical and keeping all the elements of form in mind while you try (TRY) to hit a golfball ball is TOUGH - and incredibly satisfying when you pull it off.
