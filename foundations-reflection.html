      <h1 class="header1">Foundations Reflection</h1>
      
      <h2 class="header2">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2> 
      <div>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>My ego took a bit of bruising. I'm used to picking up concepts and new skills with relative ease - JS is a PROPER challenge for me. But I'm sticking with it. Growth is painful, but not growing is more so.</li>
        <li>My ego is not that big. I ask for help and admit that I don't get a concept if I'm struggling because I'm not going to learn otherwise. </li>
        <li>I hate feeling stupid (I don't think this is a new thing I'm learning but it certainly feels like an everyday occurrence at the moment!). But developing a growth mindset is key - knowing that it's okay to not be good at something straight off the bat is acceptable and you'll get better the more you do a thing. </li>
       </ul>
    </div>
      <h2 class="header2">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p class="p">Your values shape how you see the world, and the problems in front of you. If you value kindness, then you will interact well with others. If you value honesty, then you can be up front with problems you are facing. <br>
        Empathy is important in learning - it allows you to understand what others are feeling and relate to them. <br>
        I think its important to apply empathy to ourselves on a day to day as well, especially during Foundations - understanding what we are feeling and trusting the process is important. Just because a problem is difficult today doesn't mean it will always be difficult. 

      
      <h2 class="header2">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p class="p">I don't apply the same kindness I show others to myself. I'm very self-critical and hard on myself - I'm not like that with others. So core learning has been interesting lol. Being empathetic towards yourself is almost mandatory in adopting a growth mindset.</p>

      <h2 class="header2">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p class="p">Technical knowledge vs application. Its not enough to KNOW the principles we are learning during core - we have to apply them too. It's easy to put core principle practice in the too-hard basket, but doing so means we stay the same and we don't grow.<br>
        Also mindfulness - I find the language around mindfulness off-putting and so struggle to engage with it. But. I respect the concept and understand that a lot of it is about breathing correctly, so I engage in activities that encourage breathing well more. Like going to the gym, and running. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="header2">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p class="p">Because no man is an island. We interact with people on the regular and if we don't know what our internal drivers are, and how to relate to people we are going to be fairly limited in our career growth capacity.</p>     


      <h2 class="header2">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
      <p class="p">Not at all. I think the core program is valuable both for careers, and just for our own selves! Knowing we aren't static beings, that we are emotional creatures, and that we all have something going on in our lives influencing the way we act is critical to navigating the world as well as the workplace.  </p>
