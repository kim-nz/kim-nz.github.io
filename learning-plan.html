      <h1 class="header1">Learning Plan</h1>
      
      <h2 class="header2">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p class=p>Within the next 10 years I would like to be a project manager in web development, preferably in the consultancy space of the industry.</p>
      
      <h2 class="header2">Strengths when it comes to learning</h2>
      <ul class="list">
      <li>I'm curious, so I ask a lot of questions.</li>
      <li>If I run into a problem I am able to troubleshoot it either by searching for the correct answer, or by trial and error.</li>
      <li>I am adaptive, open to taking on new ideas and constructive feedback.</li>
      <li>I'm analytical and process orientated, which so far seems to be a bonus for developers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="header2">Limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
      <ul class="list"> 
      <li>Web dev is very detailed oriented so I'm stretching some atrophied muscles.</li>
      <li>I can become too focussed on a particular thing and spend too much time on it. </li>
      <li>I can be very hard on myself. </li></ul>

      <h2 class="header2">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
    
      <p class="p">I'd like to continue to grow my communication skills. How we frame things and pose them to a group can be half the battle sometimes; on a bad day I can be pretty blunt and it's not a communication quality that works amazingly well in most environments.</li> 
      </p>

      <h2 class=header2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
      <p class="p"> <strong>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives:</strong><br><br>
      I will work to communicate openly with other learners, and facilitators to make sure we are all on the same page about what we are doing, and how. 
      I think it's also important to know your team mates - they might have something going on in their lives that may be holding them up for a minute, so getting to know them will let us all show each other some patience and grace. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:</strong><br><br>
      Excercise! Take a break, go for a run or go to the gym. Basically do something that forces me to breathe properly.
      </p>
      <h2 class=header2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
      <p class="p">If I've gone through the course material, googled the query, looked through the forums for anyone asking the same question - then I will ask for help. I don't want to be a “help vampire” but I also don't plan on wasting too much time. </p>
      <h2 class=header2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p class="p">Open, constructive feedback and communication. I need to know what I'm doing well, and what I need to work on to get better.</p>
      <h2 class=header2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
      <p class="p">We have a weekly family meeting with my dads doctors but these meetings are fairly short (max 20 minutes), and via Zoom so fairly manageable. <br>
      Apart from pottery and Golf lessons on evenings and weekends respectively, my schedule is pretty clear to concentrate on Dev Academy!</p>
