  <h1 class="header1">JavaScript & The DOM</h1>
  <h2 class="header2">An Analogy</h2>
    <p class="p">If HTML is the bare bones content of a web page, CSS is the skin and muscle defining the look of the content, and JavaScript is the nervous system making everything on the page function.</p>

  <h2 class="header2">Control Flow & Loops</h2>
    <div class="numberedList">Control flow is basically the order in which code is read. Computers read code from top to bottom. When it hits a Loop the loop is read and iterated the SPECIFIED number of times before continuing on with reading the rest of the code.
      <br>For example, say you have a regular running route that takes you to a park and back:<br>
      <ol>
      <li>Run from home to park</li>
      <li>Run around park (4 times) <em>- this is an example of a loop</em></li>
      <li>Run home</li>
    </ol>
    </div>

  <h2 class="header2">What is the DOM?</h2>
    <img class="roundPic center" src="DOM visualisation.jpg" alt="the DOM">
    <p class="p">The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like object representation of your HTML document. All the various components (elements, text content, comments etc) of your DOM (or the tree branchs) are known as <em>nodes.</em>
    <br>Every HTML element in a document has an object representation which allows us to access and modify the elements in JavaScript.
    </p>

  <h2 class="header2">Accessing Data from Arrays & Objects</h2>
    <p class="p">Arrays and Objects are methods of storing data in JavaScript. How you pull the data out of them differ.
      <br>Arrays can hold many values under one variable name, and can be pulled out based on its index position:<br>

    </p>
  <p class="p">
      Objects similarly store data within the variable, but the data is stored as named values. If you think of it like a filepath, you access the variable first, and then the named value next:<br>

    </p>

  <h2 class="header2">Functions are helpful!</h2>
    <p class="p">Functions are a list of instructions that you give the computer - functions tell the computer what to do! Functions perform specific tasks, or calculates a value, when executed (or "called"). <br>

      <br>Functions can have arguments which change how the function behaves.<br>
