  <h2 class="header2">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <div class="numberedList"> Emotional intelligence is about being able to identify and regulate your emotions and understand the emotions the others. <br>
    There are four levels of EQ:<br>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Perceiving emotions:</strong> being able to identify what you, and others, are feeling.</li>
        <li><strong>Reasoning with emotions:</strong> being able to take what you are feeling and use that emotion to your advantage in situations.</li>
        <li><strong>Understanding emotions:</strong> being able to differentiate between emotional states and understand their   specific causes (for example - just because someone is angry, doesn't mean they're angry at you. Being able to understand that someone is angry, and understanding that you are not the cause is a key part of EQ).</li>
        <li><strong>Managing emotions:</strong> being able to regulate your emotions and respond appropriately. Also, being able to manage OTHERS emotions and respond  to them appropriately.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

  <h2 class="header2">How is it different to IQ?</h2>
    <p class="p"> IQ is like booksmarts - it measures what you KNOW: your logic skills, ability to reason, and your analytical and problem solving skills. <br>
    EQ is knowing yourself, which in turn allows you to know/understand others.<br>
    </p>

  <h2 class="header2">Why is it important?</h2>
    <p class="p"> We don't live our lives in a bubble. We interact with people in our personal lives, and our work lives. EQ helps facilitate those interations and will help us manage our emotions when we're stressed or overwhelmed, aid conflict resolution, and foster more open communication.
