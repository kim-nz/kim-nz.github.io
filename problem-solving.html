<h1 class="header1">Blocked!</h1> 
  <p class="p"> Boy was I blocked during Sprint 4. Particularly when trying to solve the whereAreYou built-in method. I would say finding the solutionw as almost as frustrating because, after 6 hours of rubiks cubing it, it turns out I was INCREDIBILY close to the solution THE FIRST TIME I TRIED TO SOLVE IT. I was mad. Mad at myself, mad at the rabbit holes I'd dropped down, and mad those meddling kids for existing in the first place! 
    <br> I had psuedo-coded the problem out. I had talked to a tutor. I had taken multiple breaks (including one which took me to Sylvia Park only for the fire alarm to go off literally the same minute I walked in, which then resulted in me being stuck in peak hour traffic on the way home and blowing out my break time by about 2 hours). I had watched youTube videos on how to solve the problem. My brain just did not want to know about it. I ended up chatting to another student about it and the solution was so so so simple and I had just overly complicated the whole thing. 
    <br> I learned that my instincts are usually OK (not bang on, but OK) and even though I'm very new to this, maybe I should follow them - and the simplest path - more often. 
  </p>

<h1 class="header1">Elegance in Simplicity</h1>
  <p class="p">Conversely, I found the 'concat' and 'filter' built-in methods very logical and easy(ish) to solve. I found the solutions easily when I googled the problem, and having these answers left me feeling a little more capable. Whenever I google a question, the number of people who have the same question, or have created to tutorials to help solve the question, is relieving. It's nice to know that the problem I have is a problem that others also have. I'm not alone in the JavaScript depths! </p>

<h1 class="header1">Problem Solving Techniques</h1>
  <div class="list">
    <ul>
      <li>Pseudocode - this is like breaking a book up into chapters so that the problem flows in a logical way. Which makes sense. But I'm not very good at this at the moment because I'm still trying to learn the "order of operations" in JavaScript. I can definitely see its use, so I'll be using this a lot in the future I'm sure.</li>
      <li>Trying something - I'm really comfortable with trying something! I try EVERYTHING. And then, just like in the Scooby problem, I end up spiralling. </li>
      <li>Rubber ducky method - Everytime I've used this, it has worked. This is what I did at the beginning of the Scooby problem, and got SO close to the solution (can you tell I'm still traumatised by this exercise?). Will be using this more often now that I know it didn't actually fail me!</li>
      <li>Reading error messages - Some error messages are more helpful than others. For example, in the filter built-in method exercise I found the first error message ("EXPECTED: String, RECIEVED: undefined") to be misleading after reading the hints which broke down what the end goal was. I wouldn't have been able to figure it out quite so easily without those hints. </li>
      <li>Console.logging - this is super useful, because you can test your output and alter your code based on the error messages</li>
      <li>Googling - A fan favorite troubleshooting method, Google came in clutch this Sprint. </li>
      <li>Asking your peers and coaches for help - I'm getting better at doing this. For Sprints 1-3 I was fixated on not being a help vampire and thinking that because all the answers were probably available to me via Google, I shouldn't be asking for help - which led to a panic attack in Sprint 3 (partially fuelled by hunger lol). Now I just ask the question if I'm properly stuck.</li>
      <li>Improving your process with reflection - I'm pretty comfortable with this technique, and I'm walking away from each sprint with lessons learnt. </li>
    </ul>
