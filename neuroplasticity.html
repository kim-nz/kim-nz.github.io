<h2 class="header2">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
 <div class="list">Neuroplasticity allows your brain to adapt and change, promoting:
  <ul>
  <li>The ability to learn new things</li>
  <li>Enhanced cognitive capabilities</li>
  <li>Recovery from traumatic brain injuries</li>
  <li>Strengthening areas where function is lost or has declined</li>
  </ul>
  Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity helps us realised the brain is plastic and malleable - we aren’t limited by what we can currently do, we have the ability to get better. 
  </div>

 <h2 class="header2">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h2>
 <p class="p">Practice, practice, practice. Practice will make those neural pathways stronger over time. Whether is learning JavaScript, or learning a musical instrument, practice will build neural connections. 
 </p>

 <h2 class="header2">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
 <p class="p">Apart from all the new Dev Academy material I'm learning and engaging with on a daily basis, I'm also relearning how to play Piano, and learning how to play Golf. All of these activities require regular practice. Puzzles are a great way to keep the brain engaged, too. Crosswords and sudokus are my favorite kind of puzzles and I try to do a few every week. This boils down to enriching my environment with activities that require me to focus, and are a challenge. 
  <br> Getting good, quality rest is also important. It makes it easier to concentrate - as does exercise! Exercise clears your mind and helps you focus. 
 </p>

 <h2 class="header2">What is a Growth Mindset and why is it relevant to us</h2>
 <p class="p"> A growth mindset is a belief that your abilities are not set in stone - that intelligence and talent can be developed over time. This is really relevant for us as we go through the Dev Academy program. We are learning a lot and I for one am not immediately fluent at Javascript, for example. However, with a growth mindset I know that with work over time I can improve my skills.   
 </p>

 <h2 class="header2">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
 <p class="p">I had a slow dawning realisation that in the past I've tricked myself into believing that just because I'm at something immediately I would never be good at it. 
 </p>

 <h2 class="header2">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
 <p class="p">When something in the course material feels difficult I just need to keep in mind that with work, I'll get better at this over time. I'm pretty good at asking questions when I need to, but what I learnt last week was that I shouldn't let myself get to the point of failure before asking for help. With the amount of new material that's being thrown at us, it isn't a weakness or a sign of failure to ask for help when you need it. And the sooner you ask, the less time you waste.
 </p>

 <h2 class="header2">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h2>
 <div class="list">I'm just trying to keep in mind that :
  <ul>
  <li>I'm not actually an idiot,</li>
  <li>I have already learnt a lot,</li>
  <li>I will continue learning,</li>
  <li>I will get better at this over time.</li>
  </ul>
  And to quote Billy Ocean: “When the going gets tough, the tough get going”
