      <h1 class="header1">Identity, Values & Strengths</h1>
      <h2 class="header2">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h2>
      <p class="p"> Walking across a Yarra bridge in Melbourne a lone man was about to be assaulted by a group of men. I had to decide what I was going to do - let it happen, or intervene. I’m a pacifist by nature but I also don't have it in me to stand by and watch someone get hurt. So as I walked past the man I grabbed his arm and pulled him into my group of friends and just carried on walking with him and chatting to him about his evening. The group of men shouted a bit, but didn't follow.
        <br>There's always a good solution if you look hard enough.
      </p>
      <h2 class="header2">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
      <p class="p">I'm Indian by descent but I grew up here in Aotearoa and have always considered myself a Kiwi Kid. I have faced situations where being a brown, female foreigner has been thrown in my face as if these were negative qualities to possess (like I had a choice!). Those interactions have made me more resilient over time (admittedly, sometimes it has taken a while). <br>Society is deeply flawed, but I am a part of it - and I can work to change it.
      </p>
      <h2 class="header2">Using the evidence gathered, describe your Strengths.</h2> 
      <div>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Compassionate</li>
        <li>Relationship-centric, work WITH people</li>
        <li>Organised</li>
        <li>Good communicator</li>
        <li>Perceptive</li>
        <li>Logical, and process orientated</li>
        <li>Naturally curious and want to learn new things</li>
        <li>Delivers on goals</li>
        <li>Teacher</li>
        <li>Analytical</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
     <h2 class="header2">Using the evidence gathered, describe your Weaknesses.</h2>
     <div>
     <ul class="list">
      <li>High expectations of myself, and others</li>
      <li>Can become overly involved in situations</li>
      <li>Can be slow to make decisions</li>
      <li>Can be unbending on rules and logic</li>
      <li>Not a big risk taker</li> 
     </div>   
      <h2 class="header2">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h2>
      <p class="p">I am naturally curious and enjoy learning, so career-wise I will constantly be growing my skillset. <br>
        I'm analytical and process orientated, which so far seems to be a bonus for developers. <br>
        I communicate well, and if I have a question I will ask it. <br>
        I relate to people well and I love helping people out when they have a problem. This will probably be valuable in a team where I can contribute to the knowledgebase. <br>
        I do have high expectations of myself and others and I can see this being an issue if I get stuck because I will be hard on myself. <br>
        I can get caught up in details and it can slow me down, and get stuck in being overly legalistic. 
        </p>
      <h2 class="header2">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
      <p class="p">A focus on process and a love of learning will help me through this course, and my high expectations of myself grant me a stubbornness to overcome obstacles. My ability to relate to others will help in a group and I am always willing to share knowledge and collaborate.</p>
      <h2 class="header2">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
      <p class="p">At university we were doing a group project for a management paper which involved a presentation. This was my first encounter with team members who didn’t pull their weight and delayed completing the presentation. My (imperfect) solution to this was to do the first draft of the presentation myself, submit it to the group for review with deadlines to propose changes. While this was effective and it worked to get us a good grade, it also put the burden of the majority of the work on me. I think a better strategy would have been to implement milestones at the beginning of the project to make sure everyone worked on the project together. </p>
